# RFID-Based-Ticketing-System

A real time project useful for commuters which reduces the problem of the current paper based ticket system, by implementing RFID Card System.
We are developing a real time project useful for commuters by implementing RFID Card System. 
RFID Reader will scan the card with a particular Card UID, which is unique to every card. The card on scanning will have following functions to operate:
A. Recharge
B. Pay ticket price
C. Balance
D. Empty Card

Which will be executed by pressing the keys on the keypad.
Microcontroller used for the programming is the ARDUINO UNO.

We are using C++ as our primary language for this project.
The compiler which we are using is Visual Studio Code.

# Purpose of this project

It can be used for transport systems.
